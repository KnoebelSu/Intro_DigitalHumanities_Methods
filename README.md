# Intro_DigitalHumanities_Methods_Assignment_uploads

This is a repository that serves to upload my assignments.
It will not contain all example files from the main course repository.

New: The third assignment has an error when I try to apply the topic model for the cleaned text column from my comments_2017 dataframe. I would be thankful for some help concerning this. The next part (part 2) will focus on the sentiment analysis, which will compare the sentiments between 2017 and 2018 comments.
